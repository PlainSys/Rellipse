# Rellipse!

---

*alright here we go...*

## Whats Rellipse?

Rellipse is a "arcade" style game I made in code.org... You start with five lives (six if you count zero) and you try to get the high score by touching white "pellets" all while trying to dodge "enemies".

## Controls

| Movement | Keys |  
| ----------- | ----------- |  
| Up| "^" & "W"|  
| Down | "v" & "S"|
| Right | ">" & "D"|
| Left | "<" & "A"|

## Why Code.org??? again

I did use Khan Academy but than I gave up so I speedrun making this in code.org in one day.

## Can I add this to my websi-
